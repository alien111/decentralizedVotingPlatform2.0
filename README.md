# Decentralized voting platform 2.0
The second version of decentralized voting platform

The improvements are:
1. Validator is now multinode. One or more validator nodes can be created.
2. Backup files are now collecting all public keys of all validator nodes in all sessions. It's needed to provide stored in blockchain data validating after any amount of backup chain recreatings.
3. The blockchain is now private. Originally this is my diploma project, so it's needed to avoid 51% attack.
